Hello, I’m creating this blog in hopes of learning everything there is to do with cloud computing and server automation. 

I have previously worked as a web designer / junior front end developer at my last job. The owner of the company, who was also the founder had taught me so much about the world of IT, that I never could have imagined learning on my own. 

This later showed me that, while web development was fascinating, it just didn’t feel like something I wanted to do long term. As a matter of fact, I had been a self-taught web designer and was lucky enough for him to give me a chance at working on the site he had created.

I found myself 4 years later, in the spring of 2020 stepping down from my position to begin my self-study journey once more. This time, focusing on cloud computing. I spent the duration of spring and summer studying for the CCNA, and passed it in August of 2020. 

I started applying for help desk jobs and network administrator jobs, but had only ever received one call back. I didn’t get the job. 

After a few more months of applying for jobs and not hearing anything back. I decided I would go back to my study sessions to acquire the skills and knowledge to enter the workforce again as a DevOps engineer.

Based on what I’ve learned, the most valuable skills appear to be: 

- Linux
- AWS
- Networking
- Containerization 

I’ve already undertaken the CCNA and AWS Cloud practitioner, therefore my next steps are as follows: 

- AWS Solutions Architect
- Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator 
- Learning Docker 
- Certified Kubernetes Administrator 

I would also like to point out that I’m quite aware there isn’t really a DevOps career, but more a philosophy of a work style. Therefore, this blogs name is a play on words for the title of DevOps, but really an open ended look into the world of cloud, scripting and automation. 

On a final note, this blog isn’t really intended to help anyone learn cloud computing. But, if you’re already in the career, I welcome all constructive criticism, feedback on mistakes being made, and any suggestions on projects to work on to help tune my skills. 

If you’re not in this career and you find yourself to be someone just like me. I welcome you to join me along this learning journey.
